About the project
-----------------

Have you ever wondered if you could move the advanced search engine from this beautiful website to your favourite messenger? If the answer is positive, this bot is gotcha you in this situation!

Discord is very advanced and big, its not even a messenger in this days, more like social network with big-big coding communities, and so this bot is mainly created for those type of communities.

This project wants to add some «spicy» with its search engine through advanced either easy-to-understand commands: search any repo, user, organization or even commit while you talking with someone!

### Built-with

Octokitty was built with help of different libraries and technologies, so there are them:

<!-- There is a website, which contains icons for shields: 
* https://simpleicons.org/ 
* 
* Every icon is in SVG format, but on website there are only-white, when shields got 
* them colorized, if you want to decolozire your icon, use param of logo's color (read shield's docs).

2. Different ways of search engine: you can simply search through one repository or through entire site's database;
3. For perfect instance - find commits by changed file name, type and amount of additions/deletions and etc;

2. Clone the repository with help of any git's client;
3. Make your changes;
4. Stage made changes and push them - [step-by-step guide](https://dev.to/mrfrontend/git-101--step-2-add-stage-commit--push-3p3p) is attached;

6. Squash commits for cleaner history;

For one-single file contributioning, use a more quicker way without forking the repository through website;

More about it in this article: in [official docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork/) about syncing one-file fork.
